## Outline

- What data does PVTA collect?
- How can we access this data?
    - API
    - rpvta package
- What do the data look like?
- What can we do with the data?

## PVTA

## What about the bus tracker?

[Yes, they have one!](http://bustracker.pvta.com/InfoPoint)

- Only shows snapshot of current system.
- No way to access legacy data.

## REST API

- stands for *Representational State Transfer* (but that's not important)
- Uses HTTP, the same protocol used to access web pages. 
- Need to know the syntax (inputs) and data structure (output)
    - [We have a pdf for this.](https://github.com/UMassAmherst-GRiD/HackPVTA/blob/master/availreal-timeapi.pdf) 

## PVTA API example:

Route information for B43: http://bustracker.pvta.com/InfoPoint/rest/routes/get/30043

In order to use this I have to know: 

- B43 is route ID 30043
- how to construct the http request
- how to interpret the results

## Another one (more complicated)

Route details for B43: http://bustracker.pvta.com/InfoPoint/rest/routedetails/get/30043

## R function to do the same thing:

```{r}
# library(devtools)
# install_github("umassamherst-Grid/rpvta")
library(rpvta)
getRouteDetails
```

## The output of this function
```{r}
b43details <- getRouteDetails(30043)
str(b43details, 1)
```

## What else is in rpvta?

```{r}
ls("package:rpvta")
```

## More on rpvta package

Caveats:

- This is a quick-and-dirty package. 
- Documentation is lacking
- Function names are not consistent
- Function output is not consistent

You can help! 

- Clone the repo: https://github.com/UMassAmherst-GRiD/rpvta
- Submit a pull request
- Great way to learn about package structure

## State of the project

```
PVTA REST API %>%
rpvta package functions %>%
logging script on "the cloud" %>%
data/busLocations directory in **UMassAmherst-GRiD/HackPVTA** github repo
```

## Exercise: 

Using RStudio, clone HackPVTA repo to your computer

- Open `starterScript.R` to get started
- Have a look at the data:

```{r}
glimpse(locs)
```

## What we want to predict

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
locs %>%
  filter(RouteId == 30043, LastStop == "Haigis Mall") %>%
#   glimpse()
  ggplot(aes(x = Deviation)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)
```
