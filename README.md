# hackPVTA
Working with Pioneer Valley Transit Authority data

Uses functions in the **rpvta** package. Get this using `devtools::install_github("UMassAmherst-GRiD/rpvta")`. Note that this requires that the **devtools** package is installed.

- Uses the PVTA REST API. Documentation for this is in the avail-realtime.pdf document.
- Bus location data are in the data/busLocations directory. These are updated periodically.
- A good place to get started is with the starterScript.R
- Feel free to modify the ideas.md document with ideas for interesting analyses or data products.
