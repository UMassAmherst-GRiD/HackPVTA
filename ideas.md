## What interesting things can / should we do with PVTA data?

For every stop

- conditional distribution of arrival times, conditioned on
  - previous arrival
  - scheduled arrival
  - nearest bus location
  - other buses' timeliness at this moment in this vacinity.
  
  
Track each bus's position relative to:

- expected position (by the schedule)
- mean position (by the time)

Could have conditional distribution of bus positions, aggregated by tracking buses over a period of weeks

- When are buses going fastest / slowest (rel. to speed limit)
- When should I get off and walk vs. finish taking the bus (on campus)?
- Optimizing bus transfers
    - if bus is X minutes behind schedule, should I do something different?

- Is the bus being used efficiently (seeing to student needs?)
    - How much time does a bus arrival give students to get to class?
    - Incorporate external data about numbe of students waiting?
    - When should PVTA add additional buses (what routes, times?)
    
- What are common bus transfers? How efficient are these?
    - Puffton to/from BigY
    - Puffton to/from Target
    
- Fuel consumption per route/time/location?
    - Where to optimally put hybrid buses in system?

- What are impacts of student pedestrians crossing? 
    - Can we justify pedestrian bridges/tunnels?
